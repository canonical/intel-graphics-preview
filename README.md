# Intel Graphics Preview

## 1. Introduction
This project is a collaboration between Intel and Canonical to provide early preview of kernel and userspace support for new Intel GPUs.  Some components are directly from Ubuntu archives and some are from a [PPA](https://launchpad.net/~kobuk-team/+archive/ubuntu/intel-graphics).  

While the mainline Ubuntu 24.10 kernel already has much of the support, we are using the `linux-intel` kernel from the PPA at this time because of some additional patches that have not landed in the mainline kernel yet.

## 2. Report an Issue
